- detect that `amplify configure` has been run [see](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install#option-1-watch-the-video-guide)
- `amplify init`
- `npm install @aws-amplify/core @aws-amplify/api @aws-amplify/auth`

if not using AMAZON_COGNITO_USER_POOLS as amplify auth option, app.js boilerplate needs to change
